        Yazd (Persian: یزد [jæzd] (listen)),[2] formerly also known as
        Yezd,[3][4] is the capital of Yazd Province, Iran. The city is located
        270 km (170 mi) southeast of Isfahan. At the 2016 census, the population
        was 1,138,533. Since 2017, the historical city of Yazd is recognized as
        a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.[5] Because of generations of
        adaptations to its desert surroundings, Yazd has a unique Persian
        architecture. It is nicknamed the "City of Windcatchers" (شهر بادگیرها
        Shahr-e Badgirha) from its many examples. It is also very well known for
        its Zoroastrian fire temples, ab anbars (cisterns), qanats (underground
        channels), yakhchals (coolers), Persian handicrafts, handwoven cloth
        (Persian termeh), silk weaving, Persian cotton candy, and its
        time-honored confectioneries. Yazd is also known as City of Bicycles,
        because of its old history of bike riders, and the highest number of
        bicycles per capita in Iran. It is reported that bicycle culture in Iran
        originated in Yazd as a result of contact with European visitors and
        tourists in the last century.[6]
